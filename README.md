## Behavior Driven Development
BDD(Behavior Driven Development) focuses on users being able to identify the kind of choices they have.

This requires users to book a room , submit and wait for result.


I should, as a user,

View the available hostels in various locations.

Check out the available rooms.

You'll notice a book button that, when clicked, will take you to a booking form.

Fill out the form and submit it, then look at the payment options.
